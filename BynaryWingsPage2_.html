This page is a "work table" in which there are boxes containing brief sketches of code or ideas to be developed.
Sometimes the images in the boxes are screenshots of programs already developed in different programming languages, which I want to translate
into P5js.
The next three boxes are of this type.<br>
These boxes are just a small initial example of the content of this page.

  <p class="p2">The name of this program (written in java Processing3 mode) is GravityMaze because in this maze you can only slide 
  along the floors where you fell, as if gravity prevented us from jumping. I wanted to simulate this situation by imagining a cube 
  where a ball can only fall, every time the cube is rotated by rotating it on one of the four edges on which it rests. There are 
  other ways to simulate this behavior, including in 2D. This cube is made up of 64 cells. In the program there is an editing session 
  in which it is possible to draw the paths along the different layers of the cube. The program itself determines which walls of the 
  single cell become a "landing plane", depending on the direction from which the ball arrives. I also built a wooden version with 27 
  cells, but I assure you that it is easier to change the path with a program than with wood!

  <img class="img1" style="padding: 10px; float: right" src="images/kite_4.gif" alt="kite_4" width="300" height="auto">
  <p class="p2">I am a kite enthusiast, and have flown them in many different situations. From my point of view the most interesting 
thing is that a simulator respects the real actions that are done in a flying field, even if in an approximate way.
Winding or unwinding the line, moving forward or backward ... they must make the kite rise or fall realistically. 
To achieve this you don't need a lot of aerodynamics or math.
This simple project, started in VBnet, then continued in Processing3 java, now I would like to complete it with P5js 
and I will share it. In the images you can see the wind intensity indicators both on the vertical and on the horizontal plane.

I tried to create (in Python language) a world populated by small square cells that could interact with each other and with the world.
The procedure for describing positions and conditions and "decisions made" is based on a numerical system that uses 64 printable ASCII characters.
In this way, a search on an information network could turn into a search on text strings.
But I will talk about this in the future ...<br>
Now I want to show a diagram that indicates a simple way, which I liked to program, to establish a criterion for crossing a border.
This criterion is based on codes that indicate which and how many vertices crossed a border and where they did so.
I was very happy when I saw that Kevin Workman, on his beautiful Happy Coding website, described many other methods
<a href="https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/collision-detection"> (which you can read by activating this link) </a> to detect collisions.
I am publishing this little diagram because I think that the study of collisions, crossings and "inclusions" is sometimes simple but elegant.
... However, as I said at the beginning, this is the first "draft" of a page of ideas, inspirations, unfinished things ...
